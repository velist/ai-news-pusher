(AP) — Conservationists along the U.S.-Mexico border are working to restore the nearly vanished red-legged frog in its historical Southern California habitat. Despite COVID-19 restrictions, scientists took frog eggs from a small population in Mexico and introduced them into American ponds, where biologists used artificial intelligence to confirm that the eggs had hatched and that the frogs went on to breed, marking a significant milestone in ecosystem restoration.</p>
