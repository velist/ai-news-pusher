            <h3><a href="news/50a2b7924c48.html">Palantir Reports Sales Up 48%, Cites ‘Astonishing’ AI Impact</a></h3>
            <p>Palantir Technologies Inc. reported a 48% increase in revenue for the second quarter to more than $1 billion, citing the “astonishing impact” of artificial technology on its business.  
The data software company also raised its revenue outlook for the full year to $4.14 billion to $4.15 billion, exceeding analysts’ prior expectation of $3.91 billion. 
The shares gained about 4% in extended trading after closing at $160.66 in New York. Denver-based Palantir has seen its stock price surge more than 500% over the past year — buoyed by high expectations from investors, growth in demand for AI tools and a deep reach into both the private and public sectors. The company’s $1 billion revenue in the period ended June 30 exceeded analysts’ average estimate of $939 million. It said growth was particularly strong in the US, where sales jumped 68% to $733 million. (Source: Bloomberg)</p>

            <h3><a href="news/05249b9a3965.html">Apple CEO Tells Staff AI 'Ours to Grab'</a></h3>
            <p>Apple Inc. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook, holding a rare all-hands meeting following earnings results, rallied employees around the company’s artificial intelligence prospects and an “amazing” pipeline of products. The executive gathered staff at Apple’s on-campus auditorium Friday in Cupertino, California, telling them that the AI revolution is “as big or bigger” as the internet, smartphones, cloud computing and apps. “Apple must do this. Apple will do this. This is sort of ours to grab,” Cook told employees, according to people aware of the meeting. “We will make the investment to do it.” The iPhone maker has been late to AI, debuting Apple Intelligence months after OpenAI, Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Microsoft Corp. and others flooded the market with products like ChatGPT. And when Apple finally released its AI tools, they fell flat. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman reports. (Source: Bloomberg)</p>

            <h3><a href="news/e0ea2ae64dfb.html">Tesla Gives Musk $30 Billion Award, Saying ‘Deal Is a Deal’</a></h3>
            <p>Tesla Inc. approved an interim stock award worth about $30 billion for Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk, a massive payout meant to keep the billionaire’s attention on the automaker as a legal fight over a 2018 pay package drags on.
The new agreement includes 96 million shares of the automaker that will vest if Musk continues to serve in the top post for another two years, the company said Monday in a regulatory filing. The restricted stock has an exercise price of $23.34, equal to the price in the prior compensation plan.
The move underscores Musk’s grip on the company, even as it struggles with falling electric vehicle sales and a slumping stock price. The world’s richest person has said he wants a greater stake in Tesla as he reorients it around futuristic pursuits including artificial intelligence and driverless vehicles.
