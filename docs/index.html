            <p>Green firms in the US have found something of a lifeline in artificial intelligence after being bogged down by high interest rates, shrinking funding and, more recently, President Donald Trump’s sharp rollback of support. Clean technology companies that have inked deals to support data centers have seen their stocks soar this year, outperforming the S&P 500.. Even as some clean energy firms struggle to convince investors that they can thrive during Trump’s second term, the AI-driven surge in electric demand — the most in decades — is providing clear tailwinds for others.  KR Sridhar, Bloom Energy, founder and CEO tells Bloomberg Businessweek Daily says AI will drive the need for energy, including fuel cells.
