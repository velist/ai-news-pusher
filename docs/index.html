Robotic machines already are performing major functions in fields from manufacturing to land mine and bomb removal.</p>

            <h3><a href="news/7856fa33f1e7.html">OpenAI Eyes $500 Billion Valuation in Share Sale Talks | The Pulse 8/06/2025</a></h3>
            <p>OpenAI is in early talks about a potential sale of stock for current and former employees at a valuation of about $500 billion, people briefed on the investment discussions said, marking an enormous gain in value for the artificial intelligence leader. The company is targeting a secondary stock sale in the billions of dollars, the people said, asking to remain anonymous because they weren’t authorized to discuss the matter publicly. If the deal goes ahead, it would elevate OpenAI’s on-paper price tag by roughly two-thirds. In trade news, President Donald Trump said he’d impose increased tariffs on countries buying energy from Russia while clarifying that levies on semiconductor and pharmaceutical imports would be announced “within the next week or so.”
